     * 36 and 37, while the API 33 device this was developed against showed
     * nothing at all. It was found only because a newer emulator happened to be
     * running.

     * So the levels here are not a sample. Each is where Android changed
     * something this app relies on:
     *
     *   31  exact alarms became a permission; PendingIntent mutability required
     *   33  notifications became a runtime permission

     *   36  predictive back on by default; orientation lock ignored on large
     *       screens, which is why one of these is a tablet
     *
     * API 37 is absent deliberately: at the time of writing it ships only as
     * beta 16KB-page images, which these sources cannot name. Run that one
     * against a local emulator, as it was.
     *
     * `aosp-atd` images are the small headless ones meant for exactly this.
     * They still download several gigabytes the first time, which is why this
     * is not part of the ordinary build.
