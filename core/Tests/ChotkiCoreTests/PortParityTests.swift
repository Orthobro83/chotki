/// Every editable part of a rule, and every setting, reachable on both platforms.
///
/// A port is finished when the feature surfaces match, not when the app runs.
/// Running the Android app could never have revealed that it had no reminder
/// controls and no clock setting: a control that was never written has nothing
/// to click and nothing to fail. Only holding it against macOS finds that, and
/// this is that comparison, made mechanical.
///
/// **What this can and cannot do, stated plainly, because it has been patched
/// four times.** It reads source text. It can tell you a control was never
/// written — which is the failure that has actually happened, repeatedly, and
/// which no amount of running the app reveals because there is nothing to tap.
/// It cannot tell you a control *works*: gutting a function's body while
/// leaving its name passes this test, and was tried.
///
/// So the division is deliberate. This guards the feature *surface* across
/// three platforms. Whether each one behaves belongs to that platform's own
/// tests — `ChotkiTests` on iOS, the instrumentation suite on Android, and the
/// macOS suite — where the record can actually be read back.
///
/// Every patch it has needed came from the same mistake in a different coat:
/// searching for a word rather than for the thing. `reminders` was found in a
/// line of copy above no controls; `jurisdiction` in a read-only line;
/// `exportJSON` in the one platform of three that spells it that way. It now
/// searches whole trees for the core call behind the door, rather than a named
/// file for a name.
