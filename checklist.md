# chotki — build checklist

Ordering principle: **de-risk before you invest, and keep the port cheap.**

Two things get proven before features are built on them. First, that a notification with actions actually delivers from an ad-hoc-signed bundle. Second, that `core/` compiles and tests on Linux — because a portable core that is never built on another platform is not portable, it is only intended to be.

Marked **[manual]** where a step needs a human — a decision, a system permission, or an account.

---

## Phase 0 — Prerequisites

- [x] Verify SwiftUI + UserNotifications compile against Command Line Tools only. Confirmed 2026-08-19, SDK 15.5, MenuBarExtra probe built clean. Xcode not needed.
- [x] Verify orthocal.info is reachable and returns usable JSON for both reckonings. Confirmed 2026-08-19.
- [x] Choose project location and split personal context out of the repo.
- [x] `brew install gh` (2.97.0), `gh auth login`. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Git identity set repo-locally. Done 2026-08-19.
- [ ] **[manual]** Confirm which reckoning your parish keeps. Julian is the default, so for most Orthodox this is confirmation rather than a change.
- [x] `git init`, first commit, pushed to https://github.com/Orthobro83/chotki (public, MIT). Done 2026-08-19.

## Phase 1 — Foundations, and two spikes

Both spikes come first. Do not build on an unproven assumption.

- [x] SwiftPM workspace: `core/` package, `macos/` executable depending on it. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] `macos/build-app.sh` — bundle, `Info.plist`, bundle ID `info.chotki.app`, `LSUIElement` true. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Ad-hoc code signing, verified by `codesign --verify`. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] **SPIKE A PASSED** 2026-08-19. Authorization granted, notification delivered, and the "Mark complete" action called back through the core `Notifier` protocol. Ad-hoc signing is sufficient; no Developer ID needed for personal use.
- [x] **[manual]** Notification permission granted. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] **SPIKE B PASSED** 2026-08-19. `core/` builds and tests on `swift:6.1` Linux in 43s. A `portability-guard` job greps `core/` for Apple-only imports and was verified to fail when an `import AppKit` was planted.
- [x] Eight-pointed cross drawn programmatically as a template `NSImage` — no asset pipeline, correct inversion in dark menu bars. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Launch at login via `SMAppService` behind the core `LaunchAtLogin` protocol. Verified 2026-08-19 — registered and confirmed in `sfltool dumpbtm` and login items.

Proof: **met in full 2026-08-19.** All four CI jobs green. Notification with a working action round-tripped. Launch at login registered and verified.

> **Resolved 2026-08-19.** `macos/install.sh` installs to `/Applications` and launches from there, and the app re-asserts its login item from wherever it is actually running — so moving it off the external drive fixes the registration by itself.

## Phase 2 — Core: store and recurrence engine

No interface in this phase. Semantics first, and every line of it portable.

- [x] Storage behind a `Store` protocol. `InMemoryStore` and `SQLiteStore` (raw SQLite C API — GRDB dropped, see design.md). Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Versioned migrations; `rule`, `activation`, `occurrence` tables with a `UNIQUE(rule_id, date)` constraint making one-deviation-per-day structural. `liturgical_day` lands in Phase 3. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] `RecurrenceEngine` — pure, deterministic, storage-free. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] `EditPlanner` returns an `EditPlan` of mutations, applied atomically by `SQLiteStore.apply`. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Pause is inclusive of the day it happens; resume opens a fresh stretch and the gap is unscored. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] `exportJSON` / `importJSON`, round-trip tested across both stores. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Test suite covering:
  - [x] Monthly on the 31st clamps to the last day — all 12 months produce exactly one occurrence
  - [x] Both DST transitions, every day of March/October/November, in three time zones. Nonexistent times refused rather than silently shifted
  - [x] Leap day, including the full Gregorian century rule
  - [x] A rule taken on today invents no history behind it
  - [x] A paused stretch is absent from the due set entirely
- [x] CI runs the suite on macOS and Linux. 51 tests. Done 2026-08-19.

Proof: **met 2026-08-19.** 51 tests green on macOS and Linux.

## Phase 3 — Core: liturgical layer

- [x] `Jurisdiction` — name plus reckoning, defaulting to Julian, with a non-authoritative list of common jurisdictions. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] `OrthocalClient` behind an `HTTPFetching` seam, `FoundationNetworking` imported conditionally for Linux. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] `LiturgicalService.refresh` fetches the window and skips what is already held. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Cache-first, with an in-memory snapshot so `LiturgicalDayProvider` stays **synchronous** — the recurrence engine never awaits. `refresh` never throws; failure sets `isOffline` for the interface to reflect. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Liturgical recurrence types: fast days, seasons, great feasts — gated on `ObservanceSettings`, done 2026-08-19 in Phase 2.
- [x] `LiturgicalService` conforms to `LiturgicalDayProvider`, driving liturgical recurrences from cached data. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] **Improved on the plan:** switching re-targets rather than deleting. A cached Julian day stays a correct Julian day, so switching back costs no requests. `clearLiturgicalCache` remains for a manual refresh. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Ten recorded fixtures in the test bundle. The suite makes no network request. Done 2026-08-19.

Proof: **met 2026-08-19.** 13 Jan 2027 decodes fast-free (Leavetaking of the Nativity) on the Old Calendar and a fast on the New. Offline refresh returns nothing, throws nothing, and cached days still answer. 71 tests green on macOS and Linux.

> Discovered building this: the API takes a **civil** date in the URL but reports the date in the requested reckoning in the body — `/api/julian/2027/1/13/` answers with 31 December 2026. The cache is keyed on the civil date; keying on the reported date would misfile every Old Calendar day by thirteen days.

## Phase 4 — Core: scheduling

- [x] `Scheduler` — pure, no sleeping, no platform. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] 10-minute lead for timed rules, exempt from quiet hours by design. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Up to four reminders for untimed rules, spread across the waking day by default; `ReminderPolicy.hourly` keeps the original cadence. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Quiet hours, default 21:30–06:30, applied to unsolicited repetition only. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] `Notifier` protocol with `supportsActions`, defined in Phase 1 and driven by the scheduler. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] `cancellationIDs` covers every reminder armed for a day; completed, late, skipped, cancelled, moved and archived all silence it. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] `Clock` protocol with `FixedClock`; the whole suite runs in milliseconds with no desktop. Done 2026-08-19.

Proof: **met 2026-08-19.** A simulated August produces 31 morning reminders, 5 Sunday Liturgy reminders, 124 untimed reminders, and not one inside the quiet window. 112 tests green on macOS and Linux.

## Phase 4b — Education (core done, interface pending)

- [x] `GlossaryEntry`, `Glossary` index, category browsing, ranked search. 49 entries covering everything the app displays. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] `Glossary.scan` — longest-match, word-boundary, non-overlapping term detection over arbitrary text. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Cross-references tested to resolve, so the pane can never show a dead link. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Terms screen, reachable from anywhere a term appears, with a way back. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Browse by category and search. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] `TermText` links terms in the commemoration and the fasting description. Applied to short text only — linking a whole scripture passage would make it harder to read, not easier. The index arithmetic is tested. Done 2026-08-19.
- [ ] **[manual]** Have a priest read the glossary content. It is introductory, not authoritative.

## Phase 4c — Reminder controls (core done, interface pending)

- [x] Master switch for notifications. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Per-rule enable/disable, independent of whether the rule is scored. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Lead times: at the time, 10 / 30 minutes, 1 / 2 hours, the evening before. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Several leads on one rule, each with its own id; cancellation covers all of them. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Schema migration v3, with the upgrade path tested against a database built as version 2. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Settings interface for the master switch and the default lead. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Per-rule reminder controls in the editor: on/off and multiple lead times. Done 2026-08-19.

## Phase 5 — macOS interface

- [x] Popover at 400pt, three-tab chrome. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Month grid with fast, feast and Sunday shading, today marked. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Day list with completion, timed rules above untimed. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Add and edit as in-popover screens (not sheets — see design.md), with note and source fields. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Rule library, 24 templates grouped by category, nothing on by default, scoped by tradition. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Observance settings, three plain options, no justification prompt. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Fasting described, never prescribed — "the calendar marks this as…", plus "customarily set aside". Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Right-click quick menu on an `NSStatusItem`: mark the next rule kept, silence reminders, open, quit. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Optional old-style date line under the month name. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] `ReminderDriver` ticks the core scheduler in process and drives `MacNotifier`; banner actions route back to the model. Done 2026-08-19.

Proof: **partly met 2026-08-19.** The interface builds, runs, and renders correctly offscreen against real cached liturgical data — verified for the rule tab, library and settings. Two Phase 5 bugs were found and fixed this way: Sunday shading depended on the liturgical cache being loaded, and the render harness lost data by copying the database without its WAL.

**Still to do — [manual]:** an interactive walkthrough. Take a rule on, keep it, edit it, pause it, resume it, and confirm a banner action clears the pending reminders. Controls could not be verified by rendering, because `ImageRenderer` does not draw AppKit-backed pickers and toggles.

## Phase 6 — Core + interface: progress

- [x] `ScoringEngine` over activation-intersected, elapsed occurrences. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Full weight for 30 days, then halving every 60 — old days decay but never vanish. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Per-rule streaks that step over stood-down days rather than breaking on them. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] `Prose` — names the rule, the count, and a weekday pattern when every slip shares one. Never invents a pattern from a single slip. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Progress tab plus a detachable 90-day report window. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Setting hides the figure; the prose remains. Done 2026-08-19.

Proof: **met 2026-08-19.** Both properties are tested directly, along with: a day still ahead is never counted as missed, nothing due yet yields no figure rather than a zero, keeping something late earns partial credit, and a recent slip weighs more than an old one without the old one vanishing.

The Tone constraint is enforced by a test that renders six different shapes of report — nothing due, all kept, all late, all stood down, partial, sporadic — and asserts none of them contains failure, comparison, or shaming language.

Rendered check: the summary reads "Evening prayers slipped four times, all on Fridays. Read the day's Gospel slipped once. Everything else held." with the figure secondary and the per-rule breakdown showing 25 of 25 for a rule with four stood-down days.

## Phase 5b — A full app as well as a menu bar app

- [x] `showInDock` setting, switching activation policy live. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Main window with a sidebar; month grid beside the day's rules. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Dock icon drawn programmatically, like the menu bar template image. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Main menu including a working Edit menu. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Dock icon reopen brings the window back. Done 2026-08-19.
- [ ] **[manual]** Walk the window: sidebar sections, the wider Rule layout, and editing text with keyboard shortcuts.

## Phase 7 — Reading tab and polish

- [x] Commemoration, tone, readings with passage text. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Cached-state marker on the reading tab. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] 36 bundled passages, all from the Ante-Nicene and Nicene & Post-Nicene Fathers series or early Desert Fathers translations, one per day by day-of-year. A test rejects any source naming a modern translation still in copyright. **[manual]** Attributions await a priest's review before the app goes beyond personal use. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] First-run onboarding offering three rules, with "start with nothing for now" as an equal option. Done 2026-08-19.
- [x] Prayer rope: 33/50/100, click or space, one dot per knot, with a synthesised chime on completion and a soft click per knot. Counts and nothing else — no timing, no record, no score. Done 2026-08-19.
- [ ] **[manual]** Walk a clean install end to end, from first launch to first kept rule.

Proof: clean install to first kept rule, walked end to end.

## Later — the port

Not scheduled. Listed so the shape is known while macOS is being built.

- Windows: WinUI or Win32 tray, ICO icon, toast notifications with actions, `LaunchAtLogin` via registry Run key.
- Linux: GTK tray via StatusNotifierItem, libnotify, `.desktop` autostart entry. GNOME needs a shell extension for any tray app — a platform limitation, not something the stack choice can fix.
- Everything in `core/` is expected to be reused unchanged. Anything that is not, is a bug in the core/UI boundary.

## Glossary entries still to write `[manual]`

Terms the app uses in prayers, patristic passages or the reflections that a
newcomer will not know, where the definition is a matter for Ryan and a priest
rather than for me.
`GlossaryCoverageTests` keeps this list and this file in step — a term cannot be
dropped from the test without also being dropped from here.

- **Catholic** — the sharp one. In the Creed it means universal, and a newcomer
  reads it as Roman Catholic every time. Currently unexplained in "one holy
  catholic and apostolic Church".
- **Apostolic** — the other half of that phrase.
- **Church** — capital-C, as distinct from a building.
- **Abba** — the monastic title, in the passages from the desert fathers.
